# Assistant Instructions

## Code Style and Structure

- **Code is for humans.** Write your code with clarity and empathyâ€”assume a
  tired teammate will need to debug it at 3 a.m.
- **Comment *why*, not *what*.** Explain assumptions, edge cases, trade-offs,
  or complexity. Don't echo the obvious.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Be concise, but favour explicit over terse or
  obscure idioms. Prefer code that's easy to follow.
- **Use functions and composition.** Avoid repetition by extracting reusable
  logic. Prefer generators or comprehensions to imperative repetition when
  readable.
- **Name things precisely.** Use clear, descriptive variable and function
  names. For booleans, prefer names with `is`, `has`, or `should`.
- **Structure logically.** Each file should encapsulate a coherent module.
  Group related code (e.g., models + utilities + fixtures) close together.
- **Group by feature, not layer.** Colocate views, logic, fixtures, and helpers
  related to a domain concept rather than splitting by type.

## Documentation Maintenance

- **Reference:** Use the markdown files within the `docs/` directory as a
  knowledge base and source of truth for project requirements, dependency
  choices, and architectural decisions.
- **Update:** When new decisions are made, requirements change, libraries are
  added/removed, or architectural patterns evolve, **proactively update** the
  relevant file(s) in the `docs/` directory to reflect the latest state. Ensure
  the documentation remains accurate and current.
- **Style:** All documentation must adhere to the
  [documentation style guide](docs/documentation-style-guide.md).

## Guidelines for Code Changes & Testing

When implementing changes, adhere to the following testing procedures:

- **New Functionality:**
  - Implement unit tests covering all new code units (functions, components,
    classes). Implement tests **before** implementing the unit.
  - Implement behavioral tests that verify the end-to-end behavior of the new
    feature from a user interaction perspective.
  - Ensure both unit and behavioral tests pass before considering the
    functionality complete.
  - Ensure that new functionality is clearly documented in the
    [users' guide](docs/users-guide.md).
  - Ensure that any design decisions made are recorded in the relevant design
    document.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Before fixing the bug, write a new test (unit or behavioral, whichever is
    most appropriate) that specifically targets and reproduces the bug. This
    test should initially fail.
  - Implement the bug fix.
  - Verify that the new test now passes, along with all existing tests.
  - Ensure that any design decisions made are recorded in the relevant design
    document.
- **Modifying Existing Functionality:**
  - Identify the existing behavioral and unit tests relevant to the
    functionality being changed.
  - **First, modify the tests** to reflect the new requirements or behavior.
  - Run the tests; they should now fail.
  - Implement the code changes to the functionality.
  - Verify that the modified tests (and all other existing tests) now pass.
  - Ensure that revised functionality is clearly documented in the
    [users' guide](docs/users-guide.md).
  - Ensure that any design decisions made are recorded in the relevant design
    document.
- **Refactoring:**
  - Identify or create a behavioral test that covers the functionality being
    refactored. Ensure this test passes **before** starting the refactor.
  - Perform the refactoring (e.g., extracting logic into a new unit).
  - If new units are created (e.g., a new function or component), add unit
    tests for these extracted units.
  - After the refactor, ensure the original behavioral test **still passes**
    without modification. Also ensure any new unit tests pass.

## Change Quality & Committing

- **Atomicity:** Aim for small, focused, atomic changes. Each change (and
  subsequent commit) should represent a single logical unit of work.
- **Quality Gates:** Before considering a change complete or proposing a
  commit, ensure it meets the following criteria:
  - For Python files:
    - **Testing:** Passes all relevant unit and behavioral tests according to
      the guidelines above (run `make test` to verify).
    - **Linting:** Passes lint checks (`make lint`).
    - **Formatting:** Adheres to formatting standards (run `make check-fmt` to
      verify, use `make fmt` to apply formatting).
    - **Typechecking:** Passes type checking (`make typecheck`).

  - For Markdown files (`.md` only):
    - **Linting:** Passes lint checks (`make markdownlint` or integrated editor
      linting).
    - **Mermaid diagrams:** Passes validation using nixie (`make nixie`)
- **Committing:**
  - Only changes that meet all the quality gates above should be committed.
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages summarizing the change, following
    these formatting guidelines:
    - **Imperative Mood:** Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g.,
      "Fix bug", "Add feature" instead of "Fixed bug", "Added feature").
    - **Subject Line:** The first line should be a concise summary of the
      change (ideally 50 characters or less).
    - **Body:** Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
      Subsequent lines should explain the *what* and *why* of the change in
      more detail, including rationale, goals, and scope. Wrap the body at 72
      characters.
    - **Formatting:** Use Markdown for any formatted text (like bullet points
      or code snippets) within the commit message body.
  - Do not commit changes that fail any of the quality gates.

## Refactoring Heuristics & Workflow

- **Recognizing Refactoring Needs:** Regularly assess the codebase for
  potential refactoring opportunities. Consider refactoring when you observe:
  - **Long Methods/Functions:** Functions or methods that are excessively long
    or try to do too many things.
  - **Duplicated Code:** Identical or very similar code blocks appearing in
    multiple places.
  - **Complex Conditionals:** Deeply nested or overly complex `if`/`else` or
    `switch` statements (high cyclomatic complexity).
  - **Large Code Blocks for Single Values:** Significant chunks of logic
    dedicated solely to calculating or deriving a single value.
  - **Primitive Obsession / Data Clumps:** Groups of simple variables (strings,
    numbers, booleans) that are frequently passed around together, often
    indicating a missing class or object structure.
  - **Excessive Parameters:** Functions or methods requiring a very long list
    of parameters.
  - **Feature Envy:** Methods that seem more interested in the data of another
    class/object than their own.
  - **Shotgun Surgery:** A single change requiring small modifications in many
    different classes or functions.
- **Post-Commit Review:** After committing a functional change or bug fix (that
  meets all quality gates), review the changed code and surrounding areas using
  the heuristics above.
- **Separate Atomic Refactors:** If refactoring is deemed necessary:
  - Perform the refactoring as a **separate, atomic commit** *after* the
    functional change commit.
  - Ensure the refactoring adheres to the testing guidelines (behavioral tests
    pass before and after, unit tests added for new units).
  - Ensure the refactoring commit itself passes all quality gates.
