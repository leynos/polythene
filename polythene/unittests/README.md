# Legacy test placeholder

The shared-actions CI harness still passes ``polythene/unittests`` to pytest
when exercising Slipcover-based coverage.  The actual tests now live under the
``tests/`` directory, so this placeholder directory simply ensures that the
legacy path continues to resolve without errors.
